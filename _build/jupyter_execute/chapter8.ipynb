    "### 8.1 Finesse project website\n",
    "A project [website](https://jhustata.github.io/project/) might be a reflection of your professionalism and attention to detail. Ensure that your website is easy to navigate, with clear menus and a cohesive design. \n",
    "### 8.2 Reduce clutter  \n",
    "Clarity is key in clinical and public health research communications. Use hyperlinks to provide detailed information on a separate webpage, keeping your main page clean and focused. This allows readers to explore topics in more depth if they wish.\n",
    "### 8.3 Ensure reprodicibility\n",
    "Reproducibility is the cornerstone of scientific research. Document your code and data sources meticulously, and provide clear instructions for running analyses. This allows others to replicate your findings."
