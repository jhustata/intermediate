    "### 6.2 Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub repository [meta-llama/llama3](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3) offers a robust framework for developers to engage with Meta Llama 3, a sophisticated large language model designed for wide-ranging applications from individual projects to enterprise solutions. The repo is structured to assist users in downloading model weights, setting up their environment, and starting with model inference using pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions of the Llama 3 model, ranging from 8B to 70B parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of this repository include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The repo contains a README file that guides users through the setup process, usage, and provides general information about the capabilities and structure of the models.\n",
    "- **Community and Support**: It emphasizes community engagement and support, offering clear paths for contributors through its CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files, ensuring a welcoming and respectful collaboration environment.\n",
    "- **Access and Download Instructions**: For access to the model weights, the repo directs users to the Meta Llama website, where they must agree to a license and then follow steps to download the necessary files, which include a download script and model/tokenizer specifications for running local inference【9†source】.\n",
    "- **Inference and Utilization**: Detailed guidance for running inference scripts such as `example_chat_completion.py` and `example_text_completion.py` is provided, allowing users to effectively utilize the models for generating text or engaging in dialogue simulations【10†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository serves as a gateway for developers looking to explore and innovate with one of the most advanced language models available, providing both the tools and the community support necessary to foster creative and responsible AI development. For more detailed guidance on getting started with the Meta Llama 3, users can refer to the official documentation on the Meta Llama website【10†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this lab is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. See how the `README.md` file is used\n",
    "2. Try to edit this file\n",
    "3. Fork this repo\n",
    "4. Now retry your `#2` attempt\n",
    "5. Is the `markdown` syntax familiar?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `hw6` repo and create a `README.md` file that allows a potential collaborator to easily navigate the resources of the repo:\n",
    "1. Reproduce what you did in `hw5` in this repo \n",
    "2. Use the `README.md` as annotation or additional notes to explain what is going on\n",
    "3. Please upload any other program files to this repo for easy access\n",
    "4. Include the URL of your repo as a clickable link called [HW6](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3)\n",
    "5. Download this `.md` file from GitHub, then submit it to `CoursePlus > DropBox`"
