    "- In the Stata II (Intermediate) we'll assume all data are de-identified and have zero disclosure risk. Perhaps because we've de-identified the data or because we are using simulated datasets\n",
    "- But in Stata III (Advanced) we'll learn how to use private repos for data storage. We'll consider how to grant limited access by means of temporary \"tokens\"\n",
    "- Regardless, the parameters of our models represent reduced dimensions of data and have no associated disclosure risks\n",
    "- So we should consider \"extracting\" parameters from our data and from that point forth being 100% transparent in our workflow\n",
    "\n",

    "Virtually all scientific inferences from quantitive analyses can be made as long as you have the `beta` coefficients and the `variance-covariance` matrix following a multivariable regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these parameters have zero discolure risk, you are encouraged to have them made available to the public in your public GitHub repo\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd do the public an extra favor if you laid out a generalizable program that allows anyone to add new parameters (i.e., variables and interactions amongst them) to the model with little extra effort\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's restore the analytic dataset we'd created. If this dataset has disclosure risks, the we should extract \"all\" the relevant parameters for statistical inference, make them publically available, and display our findings\n",

Generate figures to showcase absolute risks (i.e., cumulative incidence) and relative risks (i.e., hazard ratios). You may adjust for `age`, `sex`, and `race`. But consider expanding the list of confounders so that you achieve unbiased inferences\n",
