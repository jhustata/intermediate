    "1. Importing data\n",
    "   - We'll be managing datafiles both locally and remotely\n",
    "   - In the Basic class all file management is local, but syntax for importing remote files is considered\n",
    "   - The Advanced class will be [Unix based](https://jhufena.github.io/home/act5/act_5_0/act_5_0_3.html), and Stata is but one of the statistical packages you'll be considering\n",
    "2. Performing basic queries\n",
    "   - Mostly covered in the Basic class\n",
    "3. Outputing some of your findings into .xlsx, .log, etc.\n",
    "   - Here we'll go beyond the Basic class' focus on .log & .xlsx as output files\n",
    "Today we'll build on these ideas:\n",
    "1. String values as output\n",
    "   - Lets consider the data from the week one survey\n",
    "2. Numeric values embedded within a string\n",
    "   - Using `macros`\n",
    "3. Examples beyond .xlsx and .log"

    "return list\n",

    "\n",
    "This command is your gateway to reviewing the most recent test results stored by Stata. It lists out all the statistics calculated by the last command, including the number of observations (`r(N)`), test statistics like chi-squared values (`r(chi2)`), and crucially, the p-value (`r(p)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply listing out the p-value isn't always enough, especially when preparing your findings for a broader audience, such as in peer-reviewed publications. The reporting of p-values follows specific conventions to enhance clarity and understanding. Let's explore how to apply these conventions using a conditional formatting approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Introduction to the \"quietly\" Command\n",
    "\n",
    "The first block introduces the concept of running commands 'quietly' in Stata, which suppresses the output in the Results window.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    // Your Stata commands here\n",
    "} \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `qui {`: This command is short for 'quietly'. It tells Stata to execute the commands within the braces without displaying the usual output in the Results window. It's helpful for keeping your results clean or when you're only interested in the final outcome rather than seeing every step.\n",
    "- `}`: This closing brace marks the end of the 'quietly' section. After this point, Stata will return to its default behavior, which is to display output for each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Handling p-values Less Than 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "The second block explains how to handle cases where p-values are less than 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "        local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `if r(p) < 0.01 {`: This line checks if the p-value (`r(p)`) from the last statistical test is less than 0.01. If true, the commands inside the braces will execute.\n",
    "- `local p: di \"p < 0.01\"`: Here, if the condition is met, we assign a formatted string \"p < 0.01\" to a local macro named `p`. This is a concise way to communicate that the test results are highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 Formatting p-values Between 0.01 and 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The third block focuses on p-values that fall between 0.01 and 0.05, using precision formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {\n",
    "        local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {`: This line checks if the p-value is within the specified range. The `inrange()` function is versatile, allowing for clear boundary definitions.\n",
    "- `local p: di %3.2f r(p)`: For p-values in this range, we format the number to have two decimal places (e.g., 0.03), ensuring clarity and precision in our reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.4 Formatting p-values Greater Than 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth block deals with formatting p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui {\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        local p: di %2.1f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `else {`: This part catches any cases not previously covered, essentially p-values greater than 0.05.\n",
    "- `local p: di %2.1f r(p)`: Here, we format the p-value to have one decimal place, indicating a less strict interpretation of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.5 Combining Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we combine all the parts into a cohesive whole, demonstrating how to format p-values based on their value, all within a 'quietly' block.\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    "qui { //asks Stata to work \"quietly\", until the corresponding brace is closed at the end\n",
    "    if r(p) < 0.01 {\n",
    "       local p: di \"p < 0.01\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else if inrange(r(p),0.01,0.05) {\n",
    "       local p: di %3.2f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "       local p: di %2.1f r(p)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    noi di \"p = `p'\"\n",
    "} //after this brace Stata may return to its default: \"noisely\" produce output as it runs the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This final block puts everything together, showing how to use `qui` to suppress unnecessary output while precisely formatting p-values according to their significance level. The `noi di \"p = `p'`\" line then displays the formatted p-value, completing the explanation of how to communicate statistical results clearly and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.6 Recap of the chi-square test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we start by checking if the p-value is less than 0.01. If so, we report it as \"p < 0.01\" to indicate a very high level of statistical significance. This convention signals to the reader that the result is significant beyond the conventional thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value falls between 0.01 and 0.05, we report it in a standard numeric format (e.g., 0.03), maintaining two decimal places for precision. This range indicates statistical significance at the conventional 5% level, which is widely accepted in many research disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For p-values greater than 0.05, we format them with one decimal place, acknowledging that while the result may not meet the conventional threshold for statistical significance, it is still worth reporting for a comprehensive understanding of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to formatting and reporting p-values is not just about following academic conventions; it's about making your results clear and interpretable for your audience, facilitating better understanding and discussion of your research findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, here's how the output might look after applying our formatting script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```stata\n",
    ". return list \n",
    "\n",
    "scalars:\n",
    "r(N) =  2000\n",

    "\n",
    ". qui {\n",
    "p = 0.02\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the p-value is processed and reported as \"0.02\" to fit the specified format for p-values between 0.01 and 0.05. This precision in reporting underscores the importance of statistical details in the broader narrative of your research findings.\n",

    "- `clear`: Removes all data from memory. This ensures that the workspace is clean before starting new data manipulations.\n",
    "- `postutil clear`: Clears any existing posted datasets from memory. This is particularly useful when you're about to create new posted datasets, ensuring no conflicts or errors arise from previous sessions.\n",

    "- `postfile pp str80 a float(b c) using output.dta, replace`: This line initiates the creation of a new dataset (`output.dta`) with specific variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `pp` is the name given to this posting session, `str80 a` defines `a` as a string variable with a maximum length of 80 characters, and `float(b c)` defines `b` and `c` as floating-point numbers. The `replace` option allows overwriting any existing file with the same name, ensuring that your new data is saved without issues.\n",

    "3. **Output Customization**: Offers extensive customization options for the output, including Excel file naming, variable type adjustments, and the inclusion of missingness information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax Familiarization**: Understand the command structure and syntax required to use the .ado file effectively. Pay attention to optional and required parameters and their significance.\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: Recognize the importance of variable type detection and the ability to manually adjust these settings for accurate data analysis.\n",
    "- **Output Generation**: Learn how to generate descriptive statistics tables tailored to specific research needs, including handling different variable types and exporting to Excel for presentation.\n",
    "- **Coding Best Practices**: Note the use of local and global macros, conditional logic, and loops for efficient data manipulation and analysis in Stata.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to experiment with the commands within the context of different datasets, emphasizing the importance of accurate data classification (string, numeric, and if numeric: binary, categorical, and continous) and the practicality of generating descriptive statistics tables for their research projects."
